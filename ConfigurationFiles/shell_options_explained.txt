# This file started to explain the shell options in a clear manner.

# Shell Option (xpg_echo) 

--- It determines if echo will process escape sequences.

pskumarbehl@ubuntu:~$ shopt -u xpg_echo
pskumarbehl@ubuntu:~$ echo "hello \nsunil kumar"
hello \nsunil kumar
pskumarbehl@ubuntu:~$ shopt -s xpg_echo
pskumarbehl@ubuntu:~$ echo "hello \nsunil kumar"
hello 
sunil kumar

# Shell Option (extglob)

--- extglob (extended pattern matching) â€“ with this, a pattern can be almost as powerful as a regular expression.
--- In addition to the standard asterisks, question marks and square brackets, we can also use the following five sub-patterns:
    --- ?(pattern-list): Matches empty or one of the patterns
    --- *(pattern-list): Matches empty or any number of occurrences of the patterns
    --- +(pattern-list): Matches at least one occurrences of the patterns
    --- @(pattern-list): Matches exactly one of the patterns
    --- !(pattern-list): Matches anything EXCEPT any of the patterns

The pattern-list represents one or more patterns, which can again contain these extended sub-patterns, delimited by pipe signs (|). Two simple examples:

      rm -rf !(lost+found)
      Removes everything except lost+found
      
      for x in *.@(jp?(e)g|gif|png)
      Loops through all files having extension jpg, jpeg, gif, or png
