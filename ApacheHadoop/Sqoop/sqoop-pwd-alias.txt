Below are the steps to create password alias for encrypting clear password. We have to do this for every source database sqoop is connecting to.

This is a must step before every ingestion starts and this is to be done in both GP and PROD.

1)	Login to HDFS user
dzdo su - hdfs

2)	To list the created aliases
hadoop credential list -provider jceks://hdfs/data/sqoop/keystore/hadoop-credentials-store

3)	To create a new alias
hadoop credential create <alias-name> -provider jceks://hdfs/data/sqoop/keystore/hadoop-credentials-store

4)	To delete any created alias
hadoop credential delete <alias-name> -provider jceks://hdfs/data/sqoop/keystore/hadoop-credentials-store
